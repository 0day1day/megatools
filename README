megatools - command line client application for Mega
====================================================

Megatools is a collection of programs for accessing Mega service from 
a command line of your desktop or server.

Megatools allow you to copy individual files as well as entire directory 
trees to and from the cloud. You can also perform streaming downloads for 
example to preview videos and audio files, without needing to download 
the entire file.

Megatools are robust and optimized for fast operation - as fast as Mega 
servers allow. Memory requirements and CPU utilization are kept at minimum.

You can register account using a 'megareg' tool, with the benefit of having 
true control of your encryption keys.

Mega website can be found at http://mega.co.nz.

Megatools can be downloaded at http://megatools.megous.com


Tools
=====

  megareg      Register and verify a new mega account
  megadf       Show your cloud storage space usage/quota
  megals       List all remote files
  megamkdir    Create remote directory
  megarm       Remove remote file or directory
  megamv       Move and rename remote files
  megaput      Upload individual files
  megaget      Download individual files
  megadl       Download file from a "public" Mega link
               (doesn't require login)
  megastream   Streaming download of a file
               (can be used to preview videos or music)
  megasync     Upload or download a directory tree
  megafs       Mount remote filesystem locally.


All of these tools do:

- Local caching of remote session/filesystem information 
  for faster execution. Cache is encrypted with your password 
  key.
- Support loading login credentials from a configuration file


Usage
=====

1) Register for Mega account at http://mega.co.nz or via megareg.

  megareg --register --email your@email.com --name "Your Name" --password "Your Password"

Now vait for a verification mail and run the command as asked (for example):

  megareg --verify \
    '2uGbI*******************:fArj********************:U6*********' \
    'https://mega.co.nz/#confirmciyfWXRGFNcM*************...'

Don't worry, the tool will help you with the first parameter.

2) Create ~/.megarc (on linux) or mega.ini file containing these 3 lines:

[Login]
Username = your@email
Password = yourpassword

3) Run megadf to check that megatools are able to login to your account.

4) Enjoy using megatools :)

Each of the individual tools have help that can be accessed using --help
parameter.

If you modify cloud filesystem from the Mega website or another computer,
you'll need to refresh your local cache. This can be done by using the
--reload option to any tool, or by waiting for a cache timeout. (10 minutes)


Linux Examples
==============

  # Stream video from the cloud

  megamkdir /Root/TestDir
  megaput --path /Root/TestDir video.mp4
  megastream /Root/TestDir/video.mp4 | ffplay -i -
  
  # Get public download links for all files

  megals --links

  # Download file using a public download link (parts of the link are
  # redacted)

  megadl 'https://mega.co.nz/#!6Uswg***!JOHnZ-b5dPIam_NqX-Tz6j1k*******************'


Windows Examples
================

  megadf

  megamkdir /Root/TestDir
  megaput --path /Root/TestDir C:\myfile.txt

  megamkdir /Root/SyncedMyDir
  megasync --local C:\mydir --remote /Root/SyncedMyDir

  megarm /Root/TestDir


Windows Quirks
==============

On Windows, if you see weird characters in your megals output, you'll need
to set correct CHARSET environment variable. For example on Czech Windows 
this would mean executing this command in cmd before using the tools:

  set CHARSET=CP852

This is just a cosmetic issues, internally megatools always work with UTF8
file names, and even if the tool's terminal output is corrupted, files names
of downloaded/uploaded files will be correct.
